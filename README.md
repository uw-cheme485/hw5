## Problem 1 (9.2) Interest

What is the difference between the nominal annual interest rate and the effective annual interest rate? When are these two rates equal?

## Problem 2 (9.8) Depreciation

What is depreciation? Explain how it affects the economic analysis of a new chemical process.

## Problem 3 (9.13 mod) Compounding Interest

Consider the following three investment schemes:

8.5% p.a. (nominal rate) compounded daily
9.0% p.a. (nominal rate) compounded monthly
9.5% p.a. (nominal rate) compounded quarterly

a. Which investment scheme is the most profitable, assuming that the initial investment is the same for each case?
b. What is the effective annual interest rate of the best scheme?

## Problem 4 (9.15 mod) Net Present Value

You invested $4000 eight years ago, and you want to determine the value of the investment now, at the end of year 8. During the past 8 years, the nominal interest rate has fluctuated as follows:

| Year   | Nominal Interest Rate |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| 1      | 5                     |
| 2      | 6                     |
| 3      | 8                     |
| 4      | 9                     |
| 5      | 5                     |
| 6      | 3                     |
| 7      | 4                     |
| 8      | 3                     |

If your investment is compounded daily, how much is it worth today?

## Problem 5 (9.24 mod) Annuities

You plan to finance a new car by borrowing $35,000. The interest rate is 6% p.a., compounded monthly. What is your monthly payment for a three-year loan, a four-year loan, and a five-year loan?

## Problem 6 (9.35) Profitability Criteria

For a new process, the land was purchased for $10 million. The fixed capital investment, paid at the end of year 0, is $165 million. The working capital is $15 million, and the salvage value is $15 million. The estimated revenue from years 1 through 10 is $70 million/y, and the estimated cost of manufacture over the same period is $25 million/y. The internal hurdle rate (interest rate) is $14% p.a., before taxes, and the taxation rate is 40%.

a. Using Excel, make a discrete, non-discounted cash flow diagram for this process.
b. Determine the yearly depreciation schedule using the five-year MACRS method.
c. Determine the after-tax profit for each year.
d. Determine the after-tax cash flow for each year.
e. Using Excel, draw a discrete, discounted (to year 0) cash flow diagram for this process.
f. Using Excel, make a cumulative, discounted (to year 0) cash flow diagram for this process.
g. What is the present value (year 0) of this process?

## Problem 7 (10.14) Comparison of Two Processes

Consider the following two new chemical plants, each with an initial fixed capital investment (year 0) of $15x10^6. Their cash flows are as follows:

| Year  | Process 1 ($10^6/y) | Process 2 ($10^6/y) |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1     | 3.0                 | 5.0                 |
| 2     | 8.0                 | 5.0                 |
| 3     | 7.0                 | 5.0                 |
| 4     | 5.0                 | 5.0                 |
| 5     | 2.0                 | 5.0                 |

a. Calculate the NPV of both plants for the interest rates of 6% and 18%. Which plant do you recommend? Explain the results. <br>
b. Calculate the DCFROR for each plant. Which plant do you recommend?
c. Calculate the non-discounted payback period for each plant. Which plant do you recommend?
d. Explain any differences in your answers to Parts (a), (b), and (c).

## Problem 8 (10.35 mod) Equivalent Annual Operating Cost

You are responsible for equipment selection for a new micro-fiber process. A batch blending tank is required for corrosive service. You are considering three alternatives:

| Alternative | Material | Cost ($10^3) | Maintenance Cost ($10^3) | Equipment Life (y) |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| A           | CS       | 6.5          | 5.0                      | 4                  |
| B           | Ni alloy | 16           | 3.5                      | 6                  |
| C           | Hastalloy| 24           | 2.5                      | 9                  |

The after-tax internal hurdle rate is 14% p.a. Which alternative do you recommend?

## Problem 9 (10.41 mod) Monte Carlo Simulation

You are considering buying a house with a mortgage of $250,000. The current interest rates for a mortgage loan for a 20-year period are 7.5% p.a. fixed or 6.75% p.a. variable. Based on historical data, the variation in the variable rate is thought to be from a low of 6.0% to a high of 8.5%, with the most likely value at 7.25%. The variable interest rate is fixed at the beginning of each year. Answer the following questions:

a. What are the maximum and minimum yearly payments that would be expected if the variable interest rate option is chosen? For simplicity assume that the compounding period is on year.
b. Set up a Monte-Carlo simulation by picking 20 random numbers and using these to choose the variable interest rate for each of the 20 years of the loan.
c. Calculate the yearly payments for each year using the data from Part (b). *Hint*: You should keep track of the interest paid on the loan and the remaining principle. The remaining principle is used to calculate the new yearly payment with the new yearly interest rate.
d. Construct a cumulative probability distribution of at least 50 simulations of the entire 20-year loan. Use the CFD to answer whether the variable rate is better than the fixed rate.
